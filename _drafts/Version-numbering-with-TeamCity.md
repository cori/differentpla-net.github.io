Version Numbering with TeamCity
=

One of the purposes of version numbers is so that, when a customer has a problem, you can track down the exact source code and configuration that you used to build that release. Aside: Why aren't you putting your tools in source control?

* TODO (in a different post): version number styles.
* TODO: AssemblyInfo patcher -- what does it set? What control do we have over it?
* TODO: Patching the file from MSBuild.
* TODO: Sharing version numbers across a project.
