title: Adding lager handlers at runtime

You're using lager for logging in your Erlang program, and you discover that your configuration isn't logging anything more verbose than `info`-level messages. How do you bump that up to `debug`?

Like this, for `lager_file_backend`:

    Module = lager_file_backend,
    Path = "log/debug.log",
    Id = Path,
    Config = [{file, Path}, {level,debug}],

    supervisor:start_child(lager_handler_watcher_sup, [lager_event, {Module, Id}, Config]).

Or like this, for `lager_syslog_backend`, which doesn't need an ID (because
you'd usually only have one), and where the configuration is given differently:

    Module = lager_syslog_backend,
    Config = ["ident", local7, debug],

    supervisor:start_child(lager_handler_watcher_sup, [lager_event, Module, Config]).

**Updated 2014-11-28:** This page used to document adding the event handler
directly, but given what I've learned about [supervised event
handlers](http://blog.differentpla.net/blog/2014/11/07/erlang-sup-event/), it
now shows the correct way to do it.
