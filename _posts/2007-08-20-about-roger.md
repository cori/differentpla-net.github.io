## Who Am I?

My name is Roger Lipscombe. I'm 37 years old, and I live in West London. I work for [Trayport](http://www.trayport.com/), in London. I've been at Trayport since April 2010\. Before that, I was at [1E](http://www.1e.com/) for just over 5 years.

I went to University at [Warwick University](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/), between 1994 and 1997, studying [Computer Science](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/).

I've been programming since I can remember (my dad bought a Sinclair ZX81 shortly after it came out). I'm currently working (and playing) in C++, C#, F# and T-SQL, using Visual Studio 2010 and SQL Server 2008.

Along the way, I've done a bit of QuickBasic and QuickC for DOS, a _lot_ of C and C++ for Windows (from real mode Windows 3.0 to Windows ME, and from Windows NT 3.51 to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2), a reasonable slice of C/C++ programming on Linux, learnt (and mostly forgotten) a selection of assembly language dialects, and more recently dabbled with PHP, Python and Ruby.

I've been an avid snowboarder since 2002\. I ride regular, and I'm currently on a K2 Nemesis with Flow bindings.

I've been married to Jenni since June 2006\. Our first child, Charlie, was born in May 2008\. Our second child, Alice, was born at the end of March 2010.
